## 部署智能合约到通道

用户通过调用智能合约与区块链账本进行交互，在`Hyperledger Fabric` 中智能合约部署在packages中简称链码`chaincode`, 组织验证交易或查询账本需要安装`chaincode`到它们的`peers`中，当链码安装到加入了通道（`channel`）的`peers`中，通道成员可以部署`chaincode`到该通道和使用`chaincode`中的智能合约创建或更新资产到通道中的账本

使用`Fabric`链码生命周期来部署链码到通道，链码生命周期允许多个组织在创建交易之前如何操作链码达成共识

虽然背书策略指定了哪些组织需要执行链码来验证交易，但通道成员需要使用 Fabric 链码生命周期来就链码背书策略达成一致。 有关如何在通道上部署和管理链代码的更深入概述，请参阅[Fabric chaincode lifecycle](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chaincode_lifecycle.html).。

这篇文章将使用链码生命周期来部署`asset-transfer (basic) chaincode ` 到测试网的通道中,` Fabric chaincode lifecycle `版本为v2.4

### 开启网络

```bash
cd fabric-samples/test-network
./network.sh down	#关闭正在运行的docker 容器 移除之前生成的artifacts
./network.sh up createChannel # 开启测试网络，创建通道，并让Org1和Org2加入到创建的`mychannel`中
```

使用`Peer CLI`来部署 `asset-transfer(basic)`链码到通道中，步骤如下

- 打包智能合约（下载所需依赖）
- 安装链码包
- 比准链码定义
- 提交链码定义到通道中

### 开启日志（可选）

使用`logsout tool` 工具来监听智能合约日志输出，该工具会收集不同的`docker`容器的输出到一个地方，更好的并帮助管理人员`debug`问题

开启命令：

```bash
cd fabric-samples/test-network
./monitordocker.sh fabric_test
```

### 打包智能合约

这里使用`Go`版本

进入到`fabric-samples`项目的`chaincode-go`目录

```bash
cd fabric-samples/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go
```

使用`go mudule`安装依赖，依赖在`go.mod`中可看到，设置`go 环境变量 GO111MODILE=on` 然后安装依赖到`vendor`中

```bash
go env -w GO111MODULE=on
go mod vendor
```

然后进入到`test-network`目录中

```
cd ../../test-network
```

导出终端级别的`peer` CLI命令 

```go
export PATH=${PWD}/../bin:$PATH
```

设置 `FABRIC_CFG_PATH`变量

```
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD/../config/
```

检查peer版本

```bash
peer version
```

输出

```
peer:
 Version: 2.4.4
 Commit SHA: 1473ecae6
 Go version: go1.18.2
 OS/Arch: linux/amd64
 Chaincode:
  Base Docker Label: org.hyperledger.fabric
  Docker Namespace: hyperledger 
```

使用 [peer lifecycle chaincode package](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-package)来创建链码包

```
peer lifecycle chaincode package basic.tar.gz --path ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-go/ --lang golang --label basic_1.0
```

`package basic.tar.gz` 指定创建的链码包名

`--path` 智能合约代码位置

`--label`： 指定链码标识，推荐使用链码名称+版本

### 安装链码包

安装链码到每个背书交易的节点，这里设置的背书策略为`Org1`和`Org2`，需要将链码安装到这两个组织的所有节点中

- peer0.org1.example.com
- peer0.org2.example.com

安装到`Org1`的节点中

设置变量

```bash
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:7051
```

使用`peer lifecycle chaincode install` 安装到系节点中， 该命令会返回package 的标识， package identifier 将用于后面的批准

```bash
peer lifecycle chaincode install basic.tar.gz
```

成功输出：

```
0001 INFO  [cli.lifecycle.chaincode] submitInstallProposal -> Installed remotely: response:<status:200 payload:"\nJbasic_1.0:2e20ce421c8037420718c8a3918a1eea76343b7361fffdac454181c54e5736c7\022\tbasic_1.0" > 
0002 INFO [cli.lifecycle.chaincode] submitInstallProposal -> Chaincode code package identifier: basic_1.0:2e20ce421c8037420718c8a3918a1eea76343b7361fffdac454181c54e5736c7
```

安装到`Org2`下的节点中

```
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org2MSP"
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:9051
```

安装链码

```bash
peer lifecycle chaincode install basic.tar.gz
```

### 批准链码定义

`After you install the chaincode package, you need to approve a chaincode definition for your organization. The definition includes the important parameters of chaincode governance such as the name, version, and the chaincode endorsement policy.`

查询已安装的链码

```
peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled
```

输出：

```
Installed chaincodes on peer:
Package ID: basic_1.0:2e20ce421c8037420718c8a3918a1eea76343b7361fffdac454181c54e5736c7, Label: basic_1.0
```

We are going to use the package ID when we approve the chaincode, it as an environment variable. Paste the package ID returned by `peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled` into the command below. **Note:** The package ID will not be the same for all users, so you need to complete this step using the package ID returned from your command window in the previous step.

设置链码package ID 为环境变量

```
export CC_PACKAGE_ID=basic_1.0:2e20ce421c8037420718c8a3918a1eea76343b7361fffdac454181c54e5736c7
```

Because the environment variables have been set to operate the `peer` CLI as the Org2 admin, we can approve the chaincode definition of asset-transfer (basic) as Org2. Chaincode is approved at the organization level, so the command only needs to target one peer. The approval is distributed to the other peers within the organization using gossip. Approve the chaincode definition using the [peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-approveformyorg) command:

授权链码

```
peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 1.0 --package-id $CC_PACKAGE_ID --sequence 1 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem"
```

The command above uses the `--package-id` flag to include the package identifier in the chaincode definition. The `--sequence` parameter is an integer that keeps track of the number of times a chaincode has been defined or updated. Because the chaincode is being deployed to the channel for the first time, the sequence number is 1. When the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode is upgraded, the sequence number will be incremented to 2. If you are using the low level APIs provided by the Fabric Chaincode Shim API, you could pass the `--init-required` flag to the command above to request the execution of the Init function to initialize the chaincode. The first invoke of the chaincode would need to target the Init function and include the `--isInit` flag before you could use the other functions in the chaincode to interact with the ledger.

We could have provided a `--signature-policy` or `--channel-config-policy` argument to the `approveformyorg` command to specify a chaincode endorsement policy. The endorsement policy specifies how many peers belonging to different channel members need to validate a transaction against a given chaincode. Because we did not set a policy, the definition of asset-transfer (basic) will use the default endorsement policy, which requires that a transaction be endorsed by a majority of channel members present when the transaction is submitted. This implies that if new organizations are added or removed from the channel, the endorsement policy is updated automatically to require more or fewer endorsements. In this tutorial, the default policy will require a majority of 2 out of 2 and transactions will need to be endorsed by a peer from Org1 and Org2. If you want to specify a custom endorsement policy, you can use the [Endorsement Policies](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endorsement-policies.html) operations guide to learn about the policy syntax.

You need to approve a chaincode definition with an identity that has an admin role. As a result, the `CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH` variable needs to point to the MSP folder that contains an admin identity. You cannot approve a chaincode definition with a client user. The approval needs to be submitted to the ordering service, which will validate the admin signature and then distribute the approval to your peers.

We still need to approve the chaincode definition as Org1. Set the following environment variables to operate as the Org1 admin:

```
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:7051
```

You can now approve the chaincode definition as Org1.

```
peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 1.0 --package-id $CC_PACKAGE_ID --sequence 1 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem"
```

We now have the majority we need to deploy the asset-transfer (basic) the chaincode to the channel. While only a majority of organizations need to approve a chaincode definition (with the default policies), all organizations need to approve a chaincode definition to start the chaincode on their peers. If you commit the definition before a channel member has approved the chaincode, the organization will not be able to endorse transactions. As a result, it is recommended that all channel members approve a chaincode before committing the chaincode definition.

## Committing the chaincode definition to the channel

After a sufficient number of organizations have approved a chaincode definition, one organization can commit the chaincode definition to the channel. If a majority of channel members have approved the definition, the commit transaction will be successful and the parameters agreed to in the chaincode definition will be implemented on the channel.

You can use the [peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-checkcommitreadiness) command to check whether channel members have approved the same chaincode definition. The flags used for the `checkcommitreadiness` command are identical to the flags used to approve a chaincode for your organization. However, you do not need to include the `--package-id` flag.

当有足够的组织授权成功后，其中一个组织可提交链码到通道中

```
peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 1.0 --sequence 1 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" --output json
```

The command will produce a JSON map that displays if a channel member has approved the parameters that were specified in the `checkcommitreadiness` command:

```
{
    "Approvals": {
        "Org1MSP": true,
        "Org2MSP": true
    }
}
```

Since both organizations that are members of the channel have approved the same parameters, the chaincode definition is ready to be committed to the channel. You can use the [peer lifecycle chaincode commit](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-commit) command to commit the chaincode definition to the channel. The commit command also needs to be submitted by an organization admin.

提交链码

```
peer lifecycle chaincode commit -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 1.0 --sequence 1 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt"
```

The transaction above uses the `--peerAddresses` flag to target `peer0.org1.example.com` from Org1 and `peer0.org2.example.com` from Org2. The `commit` transaction is submitted to the peers joined to the channel to query the chaincode definition that was approved by the organization that operates the peer. The command needs to target the peers from a sufficient number of organizations to satisfy the policy for deploying a chaincode. Because the approval is distributed within each organization, you can target any peer that belongs to a channel member.

The chaincode definition endorsements by channel members are submitted to the ordering service to be added to a block and distributed to the channel. The peers on the channel then validate whether a sufficient number of organizations have approved the chaincode definition. The `peer lifecycle chaincode commit` command will wait for the validations from the peer before returning a response.

You can use the [peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-querycommitted) command to confirm that the chaincode definition has been committed to the channel.

查看已提交节点

```
peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted --channelID mychannel --name basic --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem"
```

If the chaincode was successful committed to the channel, the `querycommitted` command will return the sequence and version of the chaincode definition:

```
Committed chaincode definition for chaincode 'basic' on channel 'mychannel':
Version: 1.0, Sequence: 1, Endorsement Plugin: escc, Validation Plugin: vscc, Approvals: [Org1MSP: true, Org2MSP: true]
```



## 调用智能合约

After the chaincode definition has been committed to a channel, the chaincode will start on the peers joined to the channel where the chaincode was installed. The asset-transfer (basic) chaincode is now ready to be invoked by client applications. Use the following command to create an initial set of assets on the ledger. Note that the invoke command needs to target a sufficient number of peers to meet the chaincode endorsement policy. (Note the CLI does not access the Fabric Gateway peer, so each endorsing peer must be specified.)

初始化合约，因为背书策略需要满足足够的多的节点，所以这里需要指定足够多的节点

```
peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"InitLedger","Args":[]}'
```

If the command is successful, you should see a response similar to the following:

```
2020-02-12 18:22:20.576 EST [chaincodeCmd] chaincodeInvokeOrQuery -> INFO 001 Chaincode invoke successful. result: status:200
```

We can use a query function to read the set of cars that were created by the chaincode:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["GetAllAssets"]}'
```

The response to the query should be the following list of assets:

```
[{"Key":"asset1","Record":{"ID":"asset1","color":"blue","size":5,"owner":"Tomoko","appraisedValue":300}},
{"Key":"asset2","Record":{"ID":"asset2","color":"red","size":5,"owner":"Brad","appraisedValue":400}},
{"Key":"asset3","Record":{"ID":"asset3","color":"green","size":10,"owner":"Jin Soo","appraisedValue":500}},
{"Key":"asset4","Record":{"ID":"asset4","color":"yellow","size":10,"owner":"Max","appraisedValue":600}},
{"Key":"asset5","Record":{"ID":"asset5","color":"black","size":15,"owner":"Adriana","appraisedValue":700}},
{"Key":"asset6","Record":{"ID":"asset6","color":"white","size":15,"owner":"Michel","appraisedValue":800}}]
```



## Upgrading a smart contract

You can use the same Fabric chaincode lifecycle process to upgrade a chaincode that has already been deployed to a channel. Channel members can upgrade a chaincode by installing a new chaincode package and then approving a chaincode definition with the new package ID, a new chaincode version, and with the sequence number incremented by one. The new chaincode can be used after the chaincode definition is committed to the channel. This process allows channel members to coordinate on when a chaincode is upgraded, and ensure that a sufficient number of channel members are ready to use the new chaincode before it is deployed to the channel.

Channel members can also use the upgrade process to change the chaincode endorsement policy. By approving a chaincode definition with a new endorsement policy and committing the chaincode definition to the channel, channel members can change the endorsement policy governing a chaincode without installing a new chaincode package.

To provide a scenario for upgrading the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode that we just deployed, let’s assume that Org1 and Org2 would like to install a version of the chaincode that is written in another language. They will use the Fabric chaincode lifecycle to update the chaincode version and ensure that both organizations have installed the new chaincode before it becomes active on the channel.

We are going to assume that Org1 and Org2 initially installed the GO version of the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode, but would be more comfortable working with a chaincode written in JavaScript. The first step is to package the JavaScript version of the asset-transfer (basic) chaincode. If you used the JavaScript instructions to package your chaincode when you went through the tutorial, you can install new chaincode binaries by following the steps for packaging a chaincode written in [Go](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy_chaincode.html#go) or [TypeScript](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy_chaincode.html#typescript).

Issue the following commands from the `test-network` directory to install the chaincode dependencies.

```
cd ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript
npm install
cd ../../test-network
```

You can then issue the following commands to package the JavaScript chaincode from the `test-network` directory. We will set the environment variables needed to use the `peer` CLI again in case you closed your terminal.

```
export PATH=${PWD}/../bin:$PATH
export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=$PWD/../config/
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp
peer lifecycle chaincode package basic_2.tar.gz --path ../asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript/ --lang node --label basic_2.0
```

Run the following commands to operate the `peer` CLI as the Org1 admin:

```
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=true
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org1MSP"
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:7051
```

We can now use the following command to install the new chaincode package on the Org1 peer.

```
peer lifecycle chaincode install basic_2.tar.gz
```

The new chaincode package will create a new package ID. We can find the new package ID by querying our peer.

```
peer lifecycle chaincode queryinstalled
```

The `queryinstalled` command will return a list of the chaincode that have been installed on your peer similar to this output.

```
Installed chaincodes on peer:
Package ID: basic_1.0:69de748301770f6ef64b42aa6bb6cb291df20aa39542c3ef94008615704007f3, Label: basic_1.0
Package ID: basic_2.0:1d559f9fb3dd879601ee17047658c7e0c84eab732dca7c841102f20e42a9e7d4, Label: basic_2.0
```

You can use the package label to find the package ID of the new chaincode and save it as a new environment variable. This output is for example only – your package ID will be different, so DO NOT COPY AND PASTE!

```
export NEW_CC_PACKAGE_ID=basic_2.0:1d559f9fb3dd879601ee17047658c7e0c84eab732dca7c841102f20e42a9e7d4
```

Org1 can now approve a new chaincode definition:

```
peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 2.0 --package-id $NEW_CC_PACKAGE_ID --sequence 2 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem"
```

The new chaincode definition uses the package ID of the JavaScript chaincode package and updates the chaincode version. Because the sequence parameter is used by the Fabric chaincode lifecycle to keep track of chaincode upgrades, Org1 also needs to increment the sequence number from 1 to 2. You can use the [peer lifecycle chaincode querycommitted](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-querycommitted) command to find the sequence of the chaincode that was last committed to the channel.

We now need to install the chaincode package and approve the chaincode definition as Org2 in order to upgrade the chaincode. Run the following commands to operate the `peer` CLI as the Org2 admin:

```
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID="Org2MSP"
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=localhost:9051
```

We can now use the following command to install the new chaincode package on the Org2 peer.

```
peer lifecycle chaincode install basic_2.tar.gz
```

You can now approve the new chaincode definition for Org2.

```
peer lifecycle chaincode approveformyorg -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 2.0 --package-id $NEW_CC_PACKAGE_ID --sequence 2 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem"
```

Use the [peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/peerlifecycle.html#peer-lifecycle-chaincode-checkcommitreadiness) command to check if the chaincode definition with sequence 2 is ready to be committed to the channel:

```
peer lifecycle chaincode checkcommitreadiness --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 2.0 --sequence 2 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" --output json
```

The chaincode is ready to be upgraded if the command returns the following JSON:

```
{
    "Approvals": {
        "Org1MSP": true,
        "Org2MSP": true
    }
}
```

The chaincode will be upgraded on the channel after the new chaincode definition is committed. Until then, the previous chaincode will continue to run on the peers of both organizations. Org2 can use the following command to upgrade the chaincode:

```
peer lifecycle chaincode commit -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --channelID mychannel --name basic --version 2.0 --sequence 2 --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt"
```

A successful commit transaction will start the new chaincode right away. If the chaincode definition changed the endorsement policy, the new policy would be put in effect.

You can use the `docker ps` command to verify that the new chaincode has started on your peers:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                                                                                                                                                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES

If you used the `--init-required` flag, you need to invoke the Init function before you can use the upgraded chaincode. Because we did not request the execution of Init, we can test our new JavaScript chaincode by creating a new car:

```
peer chaincode invoke -o localhost:7050 --ordererTLSHostnameOverride orderer.example.com --tls --cafile "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/msp/tlscacerts/tlsca.example.com-cert.pem" -C mychannel -n basic --peerAddresses localhost:7051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/tls/ca.crt" --peerAddresses localhost:9051 --tlsRootCertFiles "${PWD}/organizations/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt" -c '{"function":"CreateAsset","Args":["asset8","blue","16","Kelley","750"]}'
```

You can query all the cars on the ledger again to see the new car:

```
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n basic -c '{"Args":["GetAllAssets"]}'
```

You should see the following result from the JavaScript chaincode:

```
[{"Key":"asset1","Record":{"ID":"asset1","color":"blue","size":5,"owner":"Tomoko","appraisedValue":300}},
{"Key":"asset2","Record":{"ID":"asset2","color":"red","size":5,"owner":"Brad","appraisedValue":400}},
{"Key":"asset3","Record":{"ID":"asset3","color":"green","size":10,"owner":"Jin Soo","appraisedValue":500}},
{"Key":"asset4","Record":{"ID":"asset4","color":"yellow","size":10,"owner":"Max","appraisedValue":600}},
{"Key":"asset5","Record":{"ID":"asset5","color":"black","size":15,"owner":"Adriana","appraisedValue":700}},
{"Key":"asset6","Record":{"ID":"asset6","color":"white","size":15,"owner":"Michel","appraisedValue":800}},
"Key":"asset8","Record":{"ID":"asset8","color":"blue","size":16,"owner":"Kelley","appraisedValue":750}}]
```



## Clean up

When you are finished using the chaincode, you can also use the following commands to remove the Logspout tool.

```
docker stop logspout
docker rm logspout
```

You can then bring down the test network by issuing the following command from the `test-network` directory:

```
./network.sh down
```



## Next steps

by the Fabric SDKs to invoke the smart contracts from a client application. This allows end users to interact with the assets on the blockchain ledger. To get started with the Fabric SDKs, see the [Running a Fabric Application tutorial](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html).
